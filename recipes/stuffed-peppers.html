    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 bell peppers, cut in half lengthwise and remove seeds</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves farlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>15-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>1/2 cups of cooked rice</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 cups of baby spinach, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of Montery Jack cheese</li>
        <li>chopped parsley, for garnishing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
        <li>Cut the bell peppers in half lengthwise and remove seeds and membrane. Drizzle with a small amount of olive oila nd rub both the inside and outside to coat them. Arrange them upside down in two baking pans or one half sheet pan and pre-bake for about 15 minutes, while you're making the stuffing</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium high heat, drizzle two tablespoons olive oil and saut√© the garlic and onions for one minute</li>
        <li>Add the ground beeg and cook until the beef is browned, breaking it up into smaller pieces as needed</li>
        <li>Drain off any excess fat/liquid from the beef and stir in the diced tomatoes, rice, spinach, italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Stir for a minute or two until the spinach is wilted (make sure you don't drain the beef liquid down the sink, this will harden and clog your sink)</li>
        <li>Remove the bell peppers from the oven and use tongs to flip them over</li>
        <li>Fill the peppers with the mixture and top off with a drizzle of cheese. Place them back in the oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until the peppers appear soft.</li>
        <li>Top with fresh parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
